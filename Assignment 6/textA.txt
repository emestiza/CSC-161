Literary analysis is making increasing use of computer algorithms to
determine stylistic properties of texts. For example, a scholar may be
faced with the question of determining whether a newly discovered play
from the time of Shakespeare was in fact authored by
Shakespeare. Arguments for or against the attribution could be based
on similarities or differences in the vocabulary, average sentence
length, and other features of the play compared to known works by 
Shakespeare and his contemporaries.
