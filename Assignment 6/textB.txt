Arguments for or against the attribution could be based on
similarities or differences in the vocabulary, average sentence
length, and other features of the play compared to known works by
Shakespeare and his contemporaries.

In this assignment, you will create a program that compares two
literary works and calculates how similar their vocabularies are. You
will then use your program to make a guess at the authorship of a
"newly discovered" work of literature.
