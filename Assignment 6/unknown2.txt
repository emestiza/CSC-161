   THE LITTLE BOY FOUND

   The little boy lost in the lonely fen,
     Led by the wandering light,
   Began to cry, but God, ever nigh,
     Appeared like his father, in white.

   He kissed the child, and by the hand led,
     And to his mother brought,
   Who in sorrow pale, through the lonely dale,
     The little boy weeping sought.


   LAUGHING SONG

   When the green woods laugh with the voice of joy,
   And the dimpling stream runs laughing by;
   When the air does laugh with our merry wit,
   And the green hill laughs with the noise of it;

   when the meadows laugh with lively green,
   And the grasshopper laughs in the merry scene,
   When Mary and Susan and Emily
   With their sweet round mouths sing "Ha, ha he!"

   When the painted birds laugh in the shade,
   Where our table with cherries and nuts is spread:
   Come live, and be merry, and join with me,
   To sing the sweet chorus of "Ha, ha, he!"


   A  SONG

   Sweet dreams, form a shade
   O'er my lovely infant's head!
   Sweet dreams of pleasant streams
   By happy, silent, moony beams!

   Sweet Sleep, with soft down
   Weave thy brows an infant crown
   Sweet Sleep, angel mild,
   Hover o'er my happy child!

   Sweet smiles, in the night
   Hover over my delight!
   Sweet smiles, mother's smile,
   All the livelong night beguile.

   Sweet moans, dovelike sighs,
   Chase not slumber from thine eyes!
   Sweet moan, sweeter smile,
   All the dovelike moans beguile.

   Sleep, sleep, happy child!
   All creation slept and smiled.
   Sleep, sleep, happy sleep,
   While o'er thee doth mother weep.

   Sweet babe, in thy face
   Holy image I can trace;
   Sweet babe, once like thee
   Thy Maker lay, and wept for me:

   Wept for me, for thee, for all,
   When He was an infant small.
   Thou His image ever see,
   Heavenly face that smiles on thee!

   Smiles on thee, on me, on all,
   Who became an infant small;
   Infant smiles are his own smiles;
   Heaven and earth to peace beguiles.
